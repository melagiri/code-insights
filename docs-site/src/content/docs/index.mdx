	<Card title="Your Data, Your Firebase" icon="setting">
		Bring Your Own Firebase (BYOF). Session data never leaves your control — the CLI writes to your Firestore, and the dashboard reads from it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Automatic Session Sync" icon="rocket">
		Install a Claude Code hook and forget about it. Every session gets synced automatically when it ends.
	</Card>
	<Card title="LLM-Powered Insights" icon="star">
		Generate summaries, track decisions, surface learnings, and identify techniques — using your own API key with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Ollama.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Open Source CLI" icon="open-book">
		The CLI is MIT-licensed. Inspect the code, contribute features, or fork it. No black boxes.
