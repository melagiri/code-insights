	<Card title="Your Data, Your Firebase" icon="setting">
		Bring Your Own Firebase (BYOF). Session data never leaves your control — the CLI writes to your Firestore, and the dashboard reads from it. No central server, no data collection, full delete at any time.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Automatic Session Sync" icon="rocket">
		Install a Claude Code hook and forget about it. Every session gets synced automatically when it ends — titles generated, characters classified, messages parsed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="LLM-Powered Insights" icon="star">
		Generate summaries, track architectural decisions, surface learnings, and identify reusable techniques. Score your prompt quality with anti-pattern detection and efficiency tips.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Session Replay" icon="laptop">
		Read full conversation transcripts with syntax-highlighted code, collapsible thinking blocks, and tool call badges. Search and filter across hundreds of sessions.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Analytics & Cost Tracking" icon="seti:graph">
		Visualize your coding patterns with activity charts, model usage breakdowns, project comparisons, and cumulative cost tracking across providers.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Open Source CLI" icon="open-book">
		The CLI is MIT-licensed. Inspect every line of code that touches your data. Contribute features, report issues, or fork it. No black boxes.
